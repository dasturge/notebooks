    "# Spatial Transformer Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "[Spatial Transformer Networks, by Jaderberg, M. et. al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02025.pdf) explores a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) module designed by the authors at Google Deepmind.\n",
    "Spatial Transformers, aptly named, allow a network to incorporate spatial transformations, typically on the input image, which can have the effect of cropping, reorienting, or undistorting the image in question.\n",
    "The authors show how spatial transformations can take the place of attention networks, and additionally solve previous problems with translational invariance in CNNs.\n",
    "They can be added seamlessly to any neural network.\n",
    "They are differentiable, and therefore can be trained through simple backpropogation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's consider the motivations behind spatial transformer networks, starting with attention mechanisms in neural architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention mechanisms in neural networks give them the ability to focus on subsets of features. In image processing, this takes the shape of spatial localization of the features. In the paper Show,\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](img/show-attend-tell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[image from Show, Attend, and Tell](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this so effective?  Here's the intuition I could come up with: Part of it is the problem space of most testing with CNNs: Single object classification or some single object-based task. Even extending this to several objects, there is often a large amount of irrelevant background information in the images. As such, this is an effective dimensionality reduction technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "To contrast, it may not be effective for segmentation of a large number of objects, or for semantic segmentation tasks, or for something with extracting texture features.\n",
    "In other words, tasks where you might expect important features to be comprehensively spread through the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNNs, we can consider attention in other image processing terms, taking the form of a binary or probability mask over an image (or layer), thereby focusing the effective activations within a small region.\n",
    "This naive method of attention works, but with a heavy computational load. Kernels must still be computed over the whole image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another proposed option, is to crop the image.\n",
    "However, this method also faces problems, as it so far has been non-differentiable, so some sort of stochastic or baked-in cropping method must be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll see, image cropping can actually be modeled by a constrained linear transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translational Invariance\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall \\delta \\ A f = A T_\\delta f$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Translational invariance** is the property that transforming a feature map does not affect the resulting output. Convolutional Neural networks do not have this feature, instead, because of parameter sharing, they have the property that they are **translationally equivariant**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall \\delta \\  T_\\delta A f = A T_\\delta f$\n",
    "\n",
    "this *would* be totally sufficient, except that eventually, we are going to feed the network into a dense layer.  Dense layers by definition have no spatial relationships built in, so we need the CNN to be able to feed some proper positional information to the dense layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, max pooling layers create some \"translational invariance\" by only accepting one input of a local region.  Of course, this is only a very slight translation for each layer, so it's not nearly the property we're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's quickly go over basic spatial transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main concepts involved here are spatial transformations, and sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "For a much deeper look at these spatial transformations, [check out this resource](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~dhouse/courses/401/notes/affines-matrices.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"spatial transformation\" is a transformation on the *coordinate system* of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let a pixel $P$ be defined at indices: $(n, m) \\in \\mathbb{N}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "then the transformation $T_\\theta$ maps the pixel $P$ to a new point $(x', y') \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic forms of spatial transformations are linear or projective transformations, which can be represented with matrix multiplication.\n",
    "Let's look at some examples of these matrices, to have a look at what the *parameters* of such transformations are.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### linear\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we consider each pair of integer indices in the image, $U$, to be a set of spatial coordinates. Let's denote the indices as $n$, and $m$.  The spatial transformation will map each pair of indices $(n, m)$ to a pair $(x', y')$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For linear transformations, we can easily represent this transformation as a matrix. Then, depending on *how* we want to transform the matrix, we can \n",
    "\n",
    "for a \"rigid body\" transformation, we have 3 parameters, $t_x, t_y, \\theta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} &= \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) & -\\sin(\\theta) & -t_x \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) & -t_y \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} n \\\\ m \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are also called the \"degrees of freedom\" of the transform, where the degrees of freedom are the minimum number of parameters required to fully specify that type of transformation.\n",
    "In the projective transform, although the number of variables shown is 9, the last row has the constraint of always summing to 1, hence you can remove one parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "the caveat with these transforms, is that $(x', y')$ are typically not integers, which conflicts with the *digital* representation of images.\n",
    "We will need to now find the values of the transformed image at new integer points $(n', m') \\in \\mathbb{N}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this, we'll need sampling theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive Notebook Kernel**: if this notebook is being run on a kernel, we can explore affine transforms and sampling with the interactive widget below. We shall also discuss sampling more later on.\n"

    "The localization network is how the spatial transformation is decided for each input in the forward pass. \n",
    "It's simple in concept, it is a standard CNN, where the output units are the free parameters in the transformation model we choose (e.g. affine, similarity, projective, etc.).\n",
    "For example, if we wanted an affine transformation, the localization network should have 6 output units.  For a similarity transform, 4 output units, etc.\n",

Then we need to compute *which* points on the image we are sampling from after the transformation is applied, then place them into an output layer. The output layer may need not strictly be the same size as the input. In fact, the size of the output layer can be freely chosen.\n",

This is illustrated in the example above, where we see the quadrilateral of points on $U$ going directly into the next layer $V$. However, just like in the initial discussion of transformations, the points on the quadrilateral will not, in general, correspond directly to pixel coordinates in $U$. This is why we will need to *resample* the points.\n",

    "## The Localizer Network is more nuanced than the paper admits\n",

    "The authors don't make any statements about just how sensitive these layers are. Think about it:  Out of all the possible transformations, there are *a lot of them* that actually land outside of the original image entirely, or grab a useless zero region in the fashion MNIST case. Above, you can see that most images are shot out of the roi. Something is weird about the predictions as well, I can't really speak to this... To fix this, we redefine the localizer network. \n",

    "Let's give it conservatively ranged activation functions such as sigmoid and tanh, then add an identity matrix to the final theta layer.\n",
    "The idea here is that the parameters theta should start very small, and slowly learn how to change from an identity transformation (retaining the image $U$ as-is) to finding a convenient transform to $V$ to assist the standard CNN.\n"
